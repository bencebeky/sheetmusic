# sheetmusic

Random sheet music I like to play in Lilypond format.

## compilation

`make brasil.pdf` compiles `brasil.pdf` that relies on `brasil.ly`.  There is a special target `dallamok.pdf` ("melodies") that includes every source file in alphabetical order.  `make` compiles every target, including `dallamok.pdf`.
